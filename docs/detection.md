# Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation

Due to [the changes](../mmdetection/docs/compatibility.md) between MMDetection v1.x and v2.x, models directly converted from our previous implementation at [AttentiveNorm_Detection](https://github.com/iVMCL/AttentiveNorm_Detection) suffer significant performance drop.

We will train models using this refactored code and release the trained models here.
